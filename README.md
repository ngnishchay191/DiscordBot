# DiscordBot

Creating a discord bot!

## Functions

When a user types Hi/Hey/Hello or hi/hey/hello, the bot replies with a separate message saying hello @'ing the user.

When a new user joins a server, the user is greeted in a separate welcome text channel with a Welcome message and a custom generated Image to make the user feel warm.
